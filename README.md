## ðŸ’» About Me

I donâ€™t just write code.  
I see programming languages as people.

They're born in labs, nurtured by compilers, raised by communities.  
They learn, grow, and one day... compile themselves.  
They build empires, shape the world, then quietly step aside â€”  
leaving behind legacy codebases like ghosts in the machine.

I live for this.  
Low-level control. High-level thinking.  
Logic over hype. Essence over noise.

If you're here to talk clean code, dirty hacks, or the soul of software â€”  
we're already speaking the same language.
