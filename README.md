# 🐧 The Penguin Dev

Hey! I'm a developer who loves clean logic, efficient systems, and goofy penguins.

- 🧠 Obsessed with how programming languages grow, evolve, and compile themselves — like people.
- 🛠️ Tinkering with low-level tools, high-level abstractions, and everything in between.
- 🐚 Living in terminals, vibing with shells, and keeping things minimal.
- 🐧 Linux isn't just an OS. It's a philosophy. A lifestyle. A waddle.

## 🧰 Tools I Use
- Languages: C++, Python, JavaScript (and whatever else challenges me)
- Terminal Wizards: WSL, Git Bash, CMD, PowerShell
- Editors: VS Code gang 🧃
- OS: Windows (with Linux soul)

## 🧠 Philosophy
> _Programming languages are like people: born, nurtured, made independent, and eventually become legends._  
> I admire the ones that last — and learn from the ones that didn’t.

## 🔧 Projects
Coming soon... expect things that make you go “wait… you built THAT in a terminal?”

## 💬 About Me
I treat every line of code like it matters. Because it does.  
And I believe penguins should be protected — in real life and in the digital world 🐧💙
